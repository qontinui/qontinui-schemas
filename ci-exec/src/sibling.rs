//! Sibling path-dep provisioning for one CI dispatch.
//!
//! # The bug this closes
//!
//! `qontinui-coord/Cargo.toml:95` and `:101` carry Cargo **path** deps on a
//! sibling repo (`../qontinui-schemas/rust`, `../qontinui-schemas/code-graph`),
//! and `qontinui-web/backend/pyproject.toml:57` expresses the same dependency
//! at a different depth (`../../qontinui-schemas`). Both resolve to the same
//! place: **a sibling of the repo checkout**. The CI-node executor checked out
//! only the dispatched repo, one level deeper than the primary clone, so
//! `../qontinui-schemas` resolved into the `.ci-worktrees` directory and a
//! pre-existing clone at the device root did NOT satisfy the dep. On a dev box
//! that clone usually exists, so the failure looked like a cargo bug rather
//! than a layout mismatch.
//!
//! # The layout rule
//!
//! ```text
//! <QONTINUI_ROOT>/.ci-worktrees/<dispatch_id>/          <- the cleanup unit
//!                                 ├── <repo>/           <- dispatched worktree
//!                                 └── <sibling>/        <- one per [[siblings]]
//! ```
//!
//! ONE rule, deliberately not one per toolchain: the dispatched worktree sits
//! where a workspace-root sibling resolves, which satisfies Cargo's
//! `../qontinui-schemas/rust` from the repo root and Poetry's
//! `../../qontinui-schemas` from `backend/` alike. One invariant to hold
//! beats one per language.
//!
//! It also keeps `checkout::cleanup_dispatch`'s guarantee intact: everything
//! this module writes lands inside the dispatch-scoped parent, so cleanup is
//! still a single directory removal and nothing survives a dispatch — success
//! or failure. That is the precise reason an in-manifest `git clone` is
//! rejected: such a step WOULD pass argv validation (no banned metacharacter,
//! and the executor does not sandbox the filesystem), but it would be
//! unpinned and it would leak.
//!
//! # No shared clone cache
//!
//! Each dispatch clones its siblings fresh (`--depth 1`, by exact SHA). A
//! shared cache would have to live OUTSIDE the dispatch-scoped directory —
//! i.e. outside the cleanup guarantee — and would then need its own pruning,
//! its own concurrent-dispatch locking, and its own answer for a half-fetched
//! tree. The cost avoided is one shallow fetch of one repo per dispatch; the
//! property preserved is that a dispatch leaves nothing behind. Tools are
//! cached ([`crate::tools`]) because their key is an exact version; a sibling's
//! key is a commit that moves, so the two are not the same trade.
//!
//! # Which commit — the Actions lane's rule, not a third one
//!
//! Resolution mirrors `.github/actions/checkout-sibling/action.yml` (Phase A
//! landed as `a543cc7e1`/#984; Phase B is PR #1008), because the two lanes
//! must agree on which sibling tree a change compiles against or "parity"
//! means nothing:
//!
//! * The hatch is a **declared adaptation PR** — the coord dep edge the pair
//!   already declares for merge ordering — never a branch NAME. A branch name
//!   is not an identity, and the same name-matching mechanism was exploited in
//!   production on 2026-07-28 when a consumer gate went green against a branch
//!   with no pull request at all.
//! * ALL FOUR label forms are read, ALWAYS, and every match is collected
//!   rather than taking the first or the last — that is the only way two
//!   declarations naming DIFFERENT sibling PRs can be detected. Exactly one
//!   tree can be checked out, so an ambiguity is the author's to resolve, not
//!   ours to guess.
//! * A dep-edge label names the PAIR; its DIRECTION names the merge order,
//!   and merge order is orthogonal to which tree to compile against. Both
//!   directions are therefore read. Reading only the sibling-leads pair
//!   ("`downstream-of` here" / "`upstream-of` there") silently assumed the
//!   sibling always leads — false whenever the type is authored HERE and the
//!   sibling carries only generated bindings, which is a whole standing class
//!   of change, not an edge case. See [`DeclarationForm`].
//! * A pair declared in BOTH directions is a dependency CYCLE and hard-fails
//!   rather than resolving: coord would hold both PRs forever, and a green
//!   check here would hide that.
//! * Comparison is **owner-stripped**, because the owner is optional in
//!   coord's dep-edge grammar.
//! * "Absent" and "unanswered" are different answers and only the first is a
//!   NO. A rate-limited or unreachable probe is UNKNOWN and hard-fails; a
//!   404 on a PR that WAS declared is a semantic red about the declaration.
//! * Resolution is keyed on a pull request, never on the pushed ref. The
//!   CI-node lane dispatches `refs/heads/merge-candidate/<proposal_id>`, and
//!   coord pushes the SAME candidate ref into every repo of a multi-repo
//!   proposal — so keying off the ref name would compile against a tree that
//!   is force-pushed and deleted as the proposal resolves. That event class
//!   resolves to the sibling's branch with no API call at all, exactly as the
//!   composite action does.
//! * The action's LOWEST-priority answer is a **recorded pin**:
//!   `.github/sibling-pins.conf` ([`SIBLING_PIN_FILE`]), consulted only when
//!   no declaration resolved, on every one of the three no-declaration exits
//!   (no pull request; no declaration; trailing declaration declined). A
//!   `[[siblings]]` entry opts into it with `pin = "pin-file"`
//!   ([`SiblingPin::PinFile`]), and [`lookup_pin`] parses the file
//!   field-for-field as the action's `apply_pin` does — `#` strips a
//!   comment, CRs are tolerated, exactly two fields, a 40-hex lowercase SHA,
//!   a duplicate entry is ambiguous — so the two lanes cannot disagree about
//!   what the file says. #1158 pinned the Actions lane after a floating
//!   ui-bridge checkout held this repo's merge train for 5h+ on 2026-08-20;
//!   this is the CI-node half of the same close.
//!
//! **Stronger than #1008 in one place, and only one.** #1008 fetches the
//! declared PR's head SHA but the no-declaration path by BRANCH. Here both
//! paths end at the same primitive: resolve to a SHA first (`ls-remote` for
//! the branch case), then fetch that SHA and assert the checkout landed on
//! exactly it. Same resolution rule, one materialisation invariant instead of
//! two — and the resolved SHA is recorded in the dispatch log either way, so
//! "which tree did this build compile against" is answerable after the fact.
