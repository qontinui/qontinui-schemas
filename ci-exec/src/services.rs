//! Ephemeral, dispatch-scoped SERVICES for a CI dispatch: stand up the
//! containers a `[[services]]` declaration names, health-gate them before the
//! first step runs, hand the steps their connection env, and tear them down on
//! every exit path.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** `ci_node/` provisioned sibling repos and registry
//! tools; it provisioned no DATABASE. qontinui-web's manifest header records
//! the consequence precisely — its `backend-ci.yml` `test` job needs a
//! `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container and a `redis:7-alpine` container, so
//! "the backend unit suite is NOT gated here; the Actions lane remains its only
//! gate". That is the largest single block of gate coverage this lane cannot
//! reach, and it is unreachable for a structural reason rather than a
//! configuration one: *nothing in a manifest could stand a server up*.
//!
//! # This is NOT `env_agent::apply_services`
//!
//! The runner already has a thing called services, and repurposing it here
//! would be a category error. `apply_services` re-points a **long-lived
//! profile** at canonical's topology and deliberately PRESERVES credentials;
//! its blast radius is the user's persistent environment. What this module
//! creates is disposable, dispatch-scoped and credential-generating: opposite
//! lifetime, opposite blast radius. They share the word and nothing else, so
//! they share no code.
//!
//! # Declarative, from a CLOSED registry — a manifest never names an image
//!
//! `[[services]]` follows the precedent `[[siblings]]` and `[[tools]]` set: the
//! manifest NAMES a curated entry and PINS its version. It cannot supply an
//! image reference, and there is nowhere for one to live
//! (`deny_unknown_fields` on a two-and-a-bit-field struct). An image reference
//! is the container world's URL: accepting one would let a manifest make the
//! runner pull an arbitrary payload from an arbitrary registry and RUN it as a
//! network-listening server on a user's machine, which is strictly worse than
//! the arbitrary-binary-on-PATH case the tool registry already refuses. So the
//! registry below is closed, and adding an entry is a deliberate, reviewable
//! act.
//!
//! The tag a manifest pins must actually name a version
//! ([`crate::manifest`]'s `validate_image_tag`): `latest`, `stable`, `alpine`
//! and friends are rejected for exactly the reason `latest` is rejected for a
//! tool — a floating pointer makes two dispatches of one commit incomparable.
//! A tag is still a MUTABLE pointer, so an entry may additionally pin
//! `digest = "sha256:…"`, which is the only true pin; when present it is what
//! the image reference is built from.
//!
//! # No container runtime is a REFUSAL, never a skip
//!
//! A user's machine may have no Docker. That is a legitimate state and this
//! module's answer to it is a loud failure naming what is missing and what was
//! tried ([`detect_runtime`]) — never a silent skip. A skipped service turns a
//! database-backed gate GREEN while testing nothing, which is the single worst
//! outcome available on this lane: it is not a missing gate, it is a lying one.
//! The same reasoning already governs [`crate::tools`]'s missing-interpreter
//! path ("silence is never success on this lane").
//!
//! # Health-gating before steps run
//!
//! A container that is *up* is not a server that is *ready*: Postgres's
//! entrypoint runs an initdb bootstrap against a unix socket before it ever
//! listens on TCP. So readiness is probed per kind, over TCP, from INSIDE the
//! container (no host client required):
//!
//! * Postgres — `pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -p <container port>`, which the
//!   bootstrap's socket-only temp server does NOT satisfy, followed by one real
//!   `psql -c 'SELECT 1'` before the gate is declared open. "Ready" therefore
//!   means a query was answered, not that a port was open.
//! * Redis — `redis-cli ping` must answer `PONG`.
//!
//! The wait is bounded ([`READINESS_TIMEOUT`]) and a timeout FAILS the dispatch
//! with the last probe output and the container's own log tail. It never
//! proceeds to run steps against a server that has not answered.
//!
//! # Teardown: what is guaranteed, and what is not
//!
//! Guaranteed:
//!
//! * Every container is registered in the [`ServiceStack`] BEFORE it is
//!   created, so a `run` that half-succeeds, a readiness timeout, a failing
//!   later service, a failing step and a cancelled dispatch all leave a stack
//!   that still names it.
//! * The stack lives in the executor's `DispatchWorkspace`, whose `cleanup` is
//!   the single exit path of `run_dispatch` — the same path, and the same
//!   receipt-consuming type, that already guarantees the worktree is removed.
//!   Teardown therefore runs on the failure paths as well as the success path.
//! * [`ServiceStack::drop`] is a blocking last-resort reaper for the one case
//!   the async path cannot cover: a panic unwinding out of the dispatch task.
//!   It is a no-op after a normal teardown (which empties the list).
//!
//! NOT guaranteed — stated rather than implied away:
//!
//! * If the runner PROCESS dies (SIGKILL, power loss, a Job-Object kill of the
//!   whole tree), the containers survive. They are children of the container
//!   daemon, not of this process, so neither `Drop` nor the Windows Job Object
//!   reaches them — the Job Object's kill-on-close covers step children and
//!   says nothing about a daemon's containers. Every container this module
//!   creates therefore carries the label `qontinui.ci.dispatch=<dispatch_id>`,
//!   so the survivors are identifiable and sweepable
//!   (`docker ps -aq --filter label=qontinui.ci.dispatch`). That is a
//!   diagnosis aid, not a guarantee, and it is deliberately not a fleet-wide
//!   auto-sweep: a runner cannot tell another live dispatch's container from an
//!   orphan, and killing a peer's database mid-build would be a worse bug than
//!   the leak it cleans up.
//! * A dispatch removes only containers whose names it minted from its OWN
//!   dispatch id. Nothing else on the machine is ever touched — the developer's
//!   own Postgres, and a peer dispatch's containers, are outside the blast
//!   radius by construction. The one place that is scoped to the dispatch ID
//!   rather than to what this dispatch CREATED is the pre-emptive `rm -f`
//!   before a start, which clears a leftover of a crashed earlier attempt at
//!   the same id. That is deliberate and is the same widening
//!   `prepare_worktree` already makes for the dispatch directory; a dispatch id
//!   is minted once by coord, so the only thing it can hit is this dispatch's
//!   own debris.
//!
//! # Blast radius on disk and on the network
//!
//! Containers are created with **no bind mounts** (see [`run_argv`]), so no
//! HOST path is ever handed to a service, and the cleanup guarantee stated in
//! [`crate::checkout`] — exactly one directory removed, nothing outside it — is
//! unchanged by this phase. Services do still put bytes on disk: every registry
//! image declares a `VOLUME`, so the runtime gives each container an ANONYMOUS
//! volume. [`removal_argv`] removes with `-v`, which reaps that volume with the
//! container; a container the runner never gets to remove (a killed process —
//! see the Drop reaper's docs) still orphans its volume. Ports are published on `127.0.0.1` only, never
//! `0.0.0.0`, so a dispatch never exposes a database to the network the user's
//! machine is on. The published host port is EPHEMERAL (kernel-assigned), not
//! the service's well-known port, because this lane exists to serve a machine
//! that may already be running its own Postgres on 5432.
//!
//! `127.0.0.1` is also what the exported env spells — never `localhost`, which
//! on Windows resolves to `::1` first and would pay a doomed IPv6 connect
//! before reaching the IPv4-published port (the same measured trap that makes
//! every probe script in this workspace spell the runner's own port
//! `http://127.0.0.1:9876`).
//!
//! # The generated password is never on an argv, nor in this module's errors
//!
//! It is passed to the container through the runtime child's ENVIRONMENT, with
//! the argv carrying only the bare flag `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (docker and
//! podman both read that as "inherit this name from my environment"). That is
//! not tidiness. An argv is published twice over on this lane: it sits in the
//! host process table for the duration of the call, readable by every other
//! session on a machine that runs many; and it is formatted into the error
//! strings this module logs to the runner's dev log, streams live to coord, and
//! ships in the `log_tail` coord PERSISTS with the dispatch result. The
//! triggers are ordinary failures this module explicitly handles — a port race,
//! an image tag that does not resolve, a pull that exceeds its budget. A
//! per-dispatch password in a persisted remote record is exactly the hazard the
//! generation was supposed to avoid. `tools::run_capture` additionally redacts
//! the value after any `-e`/`--env` flag before formatting an argv into an
//! error, so a future caller that writes the `KEY=VALUE` form leaks nothing.
//!
//! What that does and does not cover, stated exactly rather than left to the
//! heading:
//!
//! * The value is never in the RUNNER's own environment — it is set on the
//!   runtime CLI child's `Command` for the duration of one call. On Unix
//!   `/proc/<pid>/environ` is owner-only, whereas `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
//!   world-readable, which is the asymmetry this buys; and the error strings
//!   were persisted by coord forever, which is the one it buys most.
//! * `docker inspect` still shows the container's `Config.Env` whatever form
//!   was used. That is unavoidable and is gated behind daemon access, which on
//!   this platform is already root-equivalent.
//! * The REMAINING channel is step output. [`exports_for`] hands every step
//!   `DATABASE_URL` (which embeds the password) and `PGPASSWORD`, and step
//!   stdout goes to the same progress sink and the same persisted `log_tail`,
//!   so a step that runs `env` or `set -x` republishes it. That is inherent to
//!   giving a step a database — the Actions lane does the same — and is a
//!   property of the service contract, not a defect this module can close.
//!
//! The alternatives were weighed and are worse here: `--env-file` moves the
//! secret into a file whose PATH is then on the argv and which outlives the
//! call; `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` needs a bind mount, breaking the "no `-v`, no
//! `--mount`" invariant above; `--mount type=secret` is swarm-only for `run`.
//!
//! # Env: executor-owned, so the allowlist did not move
//!
//! Steps reach a service through variables the EXECUTOR exports
//! ([`exports_for`]) — `DATABASE_URL` and the libpq `PG*` family, `REDIS_URL`
//! and `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT`. They are executor-owned for a hard reason
//! rather than a stylistic one: their values contain a port the manifest cannot
//! know (it is assigned at dispatch time) and a password the manifest must
//! never contain. The manifest's `ENV_ALLOWLIST` therefore gained no
//! connection variables; the keys were added to `EXECUTOR_OWNED_ENV` instead,
//! so a step that tries to set one is rejected with a message pointing at the
//! `[[services]]` entry that actually provides it — the same treatment
//! `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` gets.
