//! JUnit capture for a CI dispatch — the artifact that feeds coord's Tier-7
//! credibility merge gate.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists at all
//!
//! Restoring nextest to the manifest restored JUnit *emission*, but not
//! *delivery*: nextest writes the report INSIDE the dispatch worktree, which
//! [`crate::checkout::cleanup_dispatch`] deletes at the end of every dispatch.
//! Emission without capture produced a file that was created and destroyed
//! without anything ever reading it, so coord's `test_run_effects::score_for_head`
//! kept returning `None` and the credibility tier kept failing CLOSED.
//!
//! ## Where the file is
//!
//! nextest writes `<workspace-root>/target/nextest/<profile>/junit.xml`. That
//! path is **not** derived from `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (verified on this lane — the
//! executor exports `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<root>/.ci-target/<repo>` and the report
//! still lands under the workspace's own `target/`). So the search is rooted at
//! the WORKSPACE, i.e. the worktree and each step's `working_dir` (the runner's
//! own manifest runs cargo from `src-tauri/`, coord's from the repo root).
//!
//! `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is nevertheless searched too, last. That is not hedging
//! about the verified behaviour: it costs one `read_dir` and it means a future
//! nextest that DOES honour the variable degrades to "found in the other place"
//! rather than to a silently-missing gate input — the exact failure this module
//! exists to end.
//!
//! ## Auth posture (read before "simplifying" the transport)
//!
//! This artifact is carried on the dispatch RESULT POST
//! (`POST {coord}/coord/ci/dispatches/{id}/result`), which is device-JWT
//! authenticated and additionally matched against the dispatch row's assignee.
//! It is deliberately NOT sent to coord's `/coord/test-results/ingest`: that
//! route is gated on `COORD_INGEST_TOKEN`, a FLEET secret, and this lane runs on
//! customers' machines — distributing it would let any customer spoof any
//! tenant's merge-gate inputs. The result POST carries only `{format, raw}`;
//! coord derives repo, head sha and tenant from its own dispatch row, so a
//! runner cannot assert what its results are ABOUT.
