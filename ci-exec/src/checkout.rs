//! Candidate checkout: fetch the dispatched SHA into the warm primary
//! checkout, then materialize an ephemeral detached worktree for the build.
//!
//! Layout (all under QONTINUI_ROOT):
//! - primary repo dir: `<root>/<repo basename>` — the fetch target (warm
//!   objects, warm git config).
//! - **dispatch root**: `<root>/.ci-worktrees/<dispatch_id>` — the unit of
//!   cleanup. Always removed, success or failure.
//! - CI worktree: `<dispatch root>/<repo basename>` — the dispatched tree.
//! - siblings: `<dispatch root>/<sibling basename>` — materialised by
//!   [`crate::sibling`].
//!
//! # Why the worktree gained a level
//!
//! It used to be `<root>/.ci-worktrees/<dispatch_id>` directly. That put the
//! build tree one level DEEPER than the primary clone at `<root>/<repo>`, so a
//! relative path-dep (`../qontinui-schemas/rust` in Cargo,
//! `../../qontinui-schemas` from `backend/` in Poetry — different depths, same
//! resolved location) pointed at `<root>/.ci-worktrees/qontinui-schemas`
//! rather than anywhere a checkout could be placed. Giving the dispatch its
//! own parent makes `../<sibling>` land INSIDE that parent, which is
//! simultaneously:
//!
//! - the one layout rule that satisfies both toolchains, and
//! - a strictly SMALLER cleanup surface than provisioning siblings anywhere
//!   else would be, because the parent is still a single `remove_dir_all`.
//!
//! [`cleanup_dispatch`] therefore keeps one shape — worktree remove, worktree
//! unlock, directory delete, prune — with the delete widened from the worktree
//! to the dispatch root. Nothing outside `<root>/.ci-worktrees/<dispatch_id>`
//! is ever touched.
