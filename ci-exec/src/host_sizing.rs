//! Host-derived parallelism sizing for one CI dispatch.
//!
//! **Why this is derived and not a constant.** The CI-node lane runs on a
//! machine the manifest author has never seen. A static `cargo_build_jobs = 1`
//! is safe on a laptop and wastes a 128 GiB workstation; a static `= 8` OOMs
//! the laptop. The GitHub Actions lane hit the second half of that in
//! production and answered it by deriving both caps from the host's own
//! `MemTotal` (`qontinui-coord/.github/actions/cap-cargo-jobs/action.yml`).
//! This module is that rule, ported.
//!
//! **The two budgets are sized SEPARATELY and deliberately differ.** The
//! incident behind the Actions rule killed the agent TWICE on the same job:
//! attempt 1 during `Compiling qontinui-coord`, attempt 2 during the TEST
//! phase — with `6543 tests run: 6543 passed` logged moments before the agent
//! died. Bounding only the build leaves half that failure mode open, which is
//! exactly the hole coord's `.qontinui/ci.toml` papers over today by smuggling
//! `--test-threads 4` through argv.
//!
//! - **3 GiB per cargo build token.** A token is mostly an LLVM codegen
//!   thread, which is much cheaper than a whole rustc process, so this is
//!   deliberately generous. It is a sizing judgement, not a measurement — the
//!   Actions action says so in the same words, and no peak-RSS profile of the
//!   ~577k-LOC coord crate was ever taken.
//! - **1 GiB per test process**, a looser and independent budget: test
//!   processes exec'ing the same binary SHARE its text/rodata through the page
//!   cache, so only anon memory is per-process.
//! - **A hard floor of 1 build job at or below 8 GiB**, overriding the ratio's
//!   answer of 2. That is a measurement, not a judgement: the qontinui-runner
//!   workspace was observed still OOM-killing the agent at `JOBS=2` on a 7 GB
//!   host even with a 12 GB swapfile.
//!
//! The decision is a pure function of [`HostCapacity`] so it is testable
//! everywhere; only [`probe`] touches the host.
