//! Spec API broadcast event taxonomy.
//!
//! The runner's `spec_api/events.rs` broadcasts these on a single
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel; `GET /spec/subscribe` forwards them as
//! SSE events with the variant's kebab-case discriminator as the event name.
//!
//! Variants:
//! - `SpecChanged` — emitted by `POST /spec/author` after a successful IR +
//!   projection write. The original (pre-Plan 06) event; kept on the same
//!   channel so existing `event: spec-changed` SSE subscribers keep working.
//! - `SpecCheckInvoked` / `SpecCheckCompleted` — Plan 06 B-lifecycle events,
//!   emitted by `spec_api/spec_check.rs` HTTP handlers on entry / after the
//!   batch evaluator returns.
//! - `SpecCheckPolicyViolation` — emitted by the Plan 03 workflow-step
//!   handler (`step_executor/spec_check.rs`) per failed `ConjunctEvaluation`.
//!   *Emit site lands when Plan 03 ships; the variant is reserved here so the
//!   wire is ready.*
//! - `FlywheelProposalPromoted` / `FlywheelProposalDemoted` — emitted by the
//!   Plan 05 sweep handler (`POST /spec/proposals/sweep-pending`) after
//!   `storage::promote_pending` / `storage::demote_pending` succeed. *Emit
//!   sites land when Plan 05 Step 9 ships; the variants are reserved here.*
//!
//! All variants carry `snapshot_id` (where applicable) as the cross-stream
//! join key against tracing spans and
//! `workflow_verification_phase_results.result_json->>'snapshot_id'`.
